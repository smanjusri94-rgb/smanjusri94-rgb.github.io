<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<section>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. System Overview & Specifications</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    This project presents the complete design and integration of a
    <strong>22 GHz mmWave receiver front-end</strong> using the individual
    building blocks developed in previous projects: a low-noise amplifier (LNA),
    a double-balanced Gilbert-cell mixer, and a differential LC VCO.
    <br><br>
    The goal was to demonstrate system-level optimization while meeting
    stringent RF specifications under realistic power and layout constraints.
    All circuits operate from a common <strong>1.8 V supply</strong>.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Target Specifications:</strong><br>
    Frequency Range: 21–24 GHz<br>
    Conversion Gain: &gt; 27 dB<br>
    Noise Figure: &lt; 4 dB<br>
    Input Match: S11 &lt; −10 dB<br>
    IIP3: &gt; −10 dBm<br>
    Power Consumption: &lt; 60 mW (with VCO)
  </p>

<!-- BLOCK DIAGRAM -->
<section>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Receiver Architecture</h2>

       alt="Receiver Block Diagram"
       class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg">

  <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    The receiver consists of an RF LNA followed by a down-conversion mixer and
    a local oscillator. In Part I, an ideal LO source is used to evaluate the RF
    signal chain. In Part II, the designed VCO is integrated to form a
    fully self-contained receiver.
  </p>

<!-- MATCHING -->
<section>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. LNA–Mixer Conjugate Matching</h2>

  <img src="../assets/project-6/rx_match.png"
       alt="LNA to Mixer Matching Network"
       class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <img src="../assets/project-6/rx_match1.png"
       alt="LNA to Mixer Matching Network"
       class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg">

  <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Instead of matching each block to 50 Ω individually, the LNA output was
    directly conjugately matched to the mixer RF input to maximize power transfer.
    <br><br>
    Extracted impedances at 22.5 GHz:
    <br>
    <strong>LNA Output:</strong> 85.98 + j271.73 Ω<br>
    <strong>Mixer Input:</strong> 186.03 − j172.67 Ω
    <br><br>
    A compact LC network was designed using a Smith chart to transform the LNA
    output impedance to the conjugate of the mixer input impedance, significantly
    improving S22 and overall receiver gain.
  </p>

<!-- GAIN -->
<section>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Conversion Gain & Linearity</h2>

  <img src="../assets/project-6/rx_gain.png"
       alt="Conversion Gain and Linearity"
       class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg">

  <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    With optimized biasing and matching, the receiver achieves a
    <strong>peak conversion gain of 27.5 dB</strong>.
     <img src="../assets/project-6/rx_iip3.png"
       alt="Conversion Gain and Linearity"
       class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg">
    Two-tone simulations at 24 GHz confirm an
    <strong>IIP3 of −7.97 dBm</strong>, meeting the system requirement.
    <br><br>
    A careful trade-off between LNA bias current and mixer transconductance
    was used to balance linearity, gain, and power consumption.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- NOISE -->
<section>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Noise Figure Performance</h2>

  <img src="../assets/project-6/rx_nf.png"
       alt="Noise Figure Plot"
       class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg">

  <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    The receiver achieves a minimum noise figure of
    <strong>3.49 dB</strong> across the operating band.
    Noise contribution analysis shows that the LNA dominates the overall NF,
    validating the front-end noise optimization strategy.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- FREQUENCY SWEEP -->
<section>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">6. Wideband Frequency Performance</h2>

  <img src="../assets/project-6/rx_sweep.png"
       alt="Conversion Gain and NF vs Frequency"
       class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg">
    <img src="../assets/project-6/rx_sweep1.png"
       alt="Conversion Gain and NF vs Frequency"
       class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg">


  <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Sweeping the LO frequency from 21–24 GHz with a fixed IF of 100 MHz shows
    stable receiver performance across the band.
    Conversion gain decreases slightly at higher frequencies due to reduced
    switching efficiency and increased parasitic effects, while NF remains
    below 4 dB throughout.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- INTERFERENCE -->
<section>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">7. Interference & Gain Degradation</h2>

  <img src="../assets/project-6/rx_interference.png"
       alt="Gain Degradation vs Interference"
       class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg">

  <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    The receiver was tested under a strong adjacent-channel interferer.
    As interferer power increases beyond −10 dBm, noticeable gain degradation
    occurs due to mixer compression and desensitization, which is consistent
    with expected mmWave receiver behavior.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- LO LEAKAGE -->
<section>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">8. LO Leakage Sensitivity</h2>

  <img src="../assets/project-6/rx_lo_leakage.png"
       alt="LO Leakage to IF"
       class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg">

  <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    Device mismatch was intentionally introduced in the mixer transconductance
    devices to evaluate LO leakage. While ideal symmetry results in near-zero
    leakage, mismatch produces observable LO feedthrough at the IF port,
    highlighting the importance of layout symmetry in high-frequency designs.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- VCO -->
<section>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">9. Full Receiver with Integrated VCO</h2>

  <img src="../assets/project-6/rx_vco.png"
       alt="Receiver with Integrated VCO"
       class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <img src="../assets/project-6/rx_vco1.png"
       alt="Receiver with Integrated VCO"
       class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg">

  <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    The designed differential VCO was integrated as the LO source,
    forming a complete receiver front-end.
    The total DC power consumption increases to
    <strong>≈ 56.5 mW</strong>, remaining within the system constraint.
    Transient and spectral simulations confirm correct down-conversion
    and stable LO operation.
  </p>

<!-- SUMMARY -->
<section>
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">10. Final Summary</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    This project demonstrates a fully integrated mmWave receiver front-end
    meeting gain, noise, linearity, and power specifications.
    It highlights practical system-level RF design trade-offs and
    showcases end-to-end transceiver integration suitable for 5G applications.
